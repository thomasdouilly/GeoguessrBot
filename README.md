# GeoGuessr Chrome Extension Hack
A chrome extension. While playing guoguesser, click to open a new browser window containing google maps with the set location to where you are


### Setup
Just save this repo to your computer, go to `manage extensions` in your chrome browser, press `Load unpacked`, and select this folder

### Bugs
Sometimes the location won't get set unless the service worker terminal is open. In manage extensions click the blue `service worker` link in the panel for this extension (GeoGuesser Location Finder) to open the console, in the console it will print `set value` as well as the coordinate data if it's working
